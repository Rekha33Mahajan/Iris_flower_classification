# Iris_flower_classification
"Hello World" of Machine learning
  1) The code starts by loading necessary libraries and data using pandas.
  2) The data is preprocessed by encoding the target labels using LabelEncoder.
  3) Then data visualizations provide insights into the data distribution and relationships between features, helping us better              understand the dataset before applying machine learning algorithms.
  4) The dataset is split into training and test sets using train_test_split.
  5) A dictionary of classifiers is created, where each classifier is associated with its name.
  6) A loop is used to train and evaluate each classifier in the dictionary. The accuracy and classification report are printed for          each classifier.
  7) The confusion matrix is displayed for each classifier using seaborn's heatmap.
